To start the robot's leg :

  - Go in MQTT-SERIAL
  - launch setup.json , then mqtt_gateway.js (It's very important to launch them in this order)
  - then go in IHM
  - launch controller.js
  
When it's done, you can connect to the controller on your browser (make sure to be connected to the right network)
